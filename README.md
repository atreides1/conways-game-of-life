### About
Conway's game of life is a cellular automata simulation created in the 70s by mathematician John Conway.
    The game consists of a 2D grid of cells, in which each cell can either be "dead" or "alive", and marked accordingly. 
    As time goes on, the state of each cell changes depending on its surrounding environment.
    
    The rules of the "game" are simple:
        1. A live cell with two or three neighbors (horizontal, vertical, or adjacent cells) survives.
        2. A cell with less than two live neighbors or more than three live neighbors dies.
        3. Any cell (dead or alive) with three alive neighbors lives.

Fun fact: Since this was before computers were widely available,
    John Conway would plot the cells by hand. Just imagine how convenient a computer must have been!
